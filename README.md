# NightSong App Setup

This project uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for authentication and storing posts. Before running the app you need to configure your Supabase project.

1. Create a new project in Supabase.
2. Open the SQL editor and run `sql/setup.sql`, `sql/profiles.sql` **and** `sql/likes.sql` from this repo. This creates the required tables (including nested replies) and rowâ€‘level security policies so posts persist across sessions and are visible to all users. Replies can be nested indefinitely by replying to any reply in the thread. The `likes` table with triggers keeps like counts in sync.

   The updated `sql/setup.sql` also adds policies so authenticated users can upload to the `profile-images` bucket. Re-run the script if your database is missing the `avatar_url` column or these policies.

3. In the **Storage** section of Supabase create a bucket named `profile-images` and make it public. Profile pictures uploaded by users are stored here.
4. Copy your project's URL and `anon` key into `lib/supabase.js`.
5. Install dependencies with `npm install`.

With the database configured you can run `npm start` to launch the Expo app.
