# NightSong App Setup

This project uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for authentication and storing posts. Before running the app you need to configure your Supabase project.

1. Create a new project in Supabase.
2. Open the SQL editor and run `sql/setup.sql` from this repo. This creates the required tables and rowâ€‘level security policies so posts persist across sessions and are visible to all users.
3. Copy your project's URL and `anon` key into `lib/supabase.js`.

After installing dependencies with `npm install` (which will include
`@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` for caching posts), run
`npm start` to launch the Expo app.
