# NightSong App Setup

This project uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for authentication and storing posts. Before running the app you need to configure your Supabase project.

1. Create a new project in Supabase.
2. Open the SQL editor and run `sql/setup.sql`, `sql/profiles.sql` **and** `sql/likes.sql` from this repo. This creates the required tables (including nested replies) and rowâ€‘level security policies so posts persist across sessions and are visible to all users. Replies can be nested indefinitely by replying to any reply in the thread. The `likes` table with triggers keeps like counts in sync.
   - Create a storage bucket called `profile-images` and enable public access so profile pictures can be stored. Run the updated `sql/setup.sql` to grant authenticated users permission to upload images to this bucket.



3. Copy your project's URL and `anon` key into `lib/supabase.js`.
4. Install dependencies with `npm install`.

With the database configured you can run `npm start` to launch the Expo app.
