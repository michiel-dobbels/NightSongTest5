# NightSong App Setup

This project uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for authentication and storing posts. Before running the app you need to configure your Supabase project.

1. Create a new project in Supabase.
2. Open the SQL editor and run `sql/setup.sql`, `sql/profiles.sql`, `sql/likes.sql` **and** `sql/follows.sql` from this repo. This creates the required tables (including nested replies) and rowâ€‘level security policies so posts persist across sessions and are visible to all users. The profiles script also adds `image_url` and `banner_url` columns so your avatar and banner images stay saved. Replies can be nested indefinitely by replying to any reply in the thread. The `likes` table with triggers keeps like counts in sync. The new `follows` table prevents duplicate follows and enforces that users can only follow on their own behalf.


3. Copy your project's URL and `anon` key into `lib/supabase.js`.
4. Install dependencies with `npm install`.

With the database configured you can run `npm start` to launch the Expo app.
